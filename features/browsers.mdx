  "Fully capable Chrome instances with Extensions and remote control support."

Browserbase gives you access to a Chromium Browser (custom-built for advanced
performances and [Stealth Mode](/features/stealth-mode)).

## Configuration

The Browser Sessions runs on with the following Chromium flags:

- `--headless=new`
- `--no-sandbox`
- `--disable-blink-features=AutomationControlled`

The viewport, user agents, and header configuration are handled by the
[fingerprint mechanism](/features/stealth-mode).

Downloads are enabled and stored by default,
[accessible via the API](/features/sessions#downloading-files).

## Resources & Limits

Browser Sessions runs on fast and dedicated instances with isolated resources
(storage, network, memory, and vCPUs).

The following limits exist and are being worked on:

- Only Chromium is available.
- File uploads are untested; contact us if you have issues.
- Browser instances currently run without GPUs; expect slower animations.

## Patterns

### Control the Browser remotely

Some use cases benefit from human-in-the-loop functionality. As you may have
noticed in the Playground, our browsers can be controlled remotely. Please note
this is an experimental feature. We're still working on improving browser
compatibility and reliability. For now, this page will only load on Chromium
browsers.

1. Use the Session API to
   [create a new session](/api-reference/create-a-session).
2. Then, use the
   [Session API debug endpoint](/api-reference/retrieve-a-session-debug-connection-urls)
   to get the `debuggerFullscreenUrl`.
3. Finally, open the `debuggerFullscreenUrl` URL in Chrome to start taking
   action on the session.

The following sections provide use cases with ready-to-use snippets.

### Loading a custom extension

A custom Chrome extension is necessary for some use cases to enable advanced
browser features. Extension support with headless Chrome has always been
limited, but with Browserbase, it's easy.

1. First, use the
   [Extension API upload endpoint](/api-reference/upload-an-extension) to upload
   an extension and get back an extension `id`

<Note>

- You must upload a valid unpacked Chrome Extension in a .zip file format
  containing a manifest.json at the root.
- Starting a session with a Chrome Extension will increase session creation time
  slightly, as we have to load the extension and restart the browser.

</Note>

2. Then, use the
   [Session API create session endpoint](/api-reference/create-a-session) to
   create a new session. Make sure to include `extensionId` in the body.
3. Finally,
   [connect to the browser using the `session id`](/api-reference/list-all-sessions):

`wss://connect.browserbase.com?apiKey=${process.env.BROWSERBASE_API_KEY}&sessionId=${sessionId}`

To confirm your extension is loaded, use the following snippet:

{/* TODO: Puppeteer + Selenium examples */}

```js
import { chromium } from "playwright-core";
(async () => {
  const session = await createSession();
  // Specify the URL and expected title for the test
  const url = "chrome://extensions";

  // Launch a browser instance
  const browser = await chromium.connectOverCDP(
    `wss://connect.browserbase.com?apiKey=${process.env.BROWSERBASE_API_KEY}&sessionId=${session.id}`,
  );

  // Create a new page
  const page = await browser.newPage();
  // Navigate to the URL
  await page.goto(url);
  const element = await page
    .getByRole("heading", { name: "My custom chrome extension" })
    .textContent();

  // Ensure the browser is closed after the test
  await browser.close();
})().catch((error) => console.error(error.message));
```
