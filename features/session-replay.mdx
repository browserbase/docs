Session Replay is accessible from the Dashboard by clicking on a Session item.
The Session Replay page provides all the tools to inspect a session and pinpoint
possible problems like network issues, anti-bot mechanisms, or asynchronous
events resulting in mismatches of selectors.

A full video recording is available at the top, along with essential metrics
(duration, status, resources used):

<Frame>
  <img src="/images/session-replay/video-and-metrics.png" />
</Frame>

Followed by the timeline view, exposing each step of the Session in great detail
(ex, list of user and network events):

<Frame>
  <img src="/images/session-replay/timeline.png" />
</Frame>

Raw logs are also accessible, for example, to quickly filter errors:

<Frame>
  <img src="/images/session-replay/logs.png" />
</Frame>

<Note>
  - Logs can also be retrieved [using the Session API](/api-reference/sessions).
  - Refer to the [Chrome DevTools Protocol documentation](https://chromedevtools.github.io/devtools-protocol/) for the list of available events.
