Browserbase's [custom-built Chromium Browser](/features/browsers) comes with
a set of features enabling you to navigate in Stealth mode.

## Features

### Proxies & Residential IPs

Each Session gets a new Residential IP. Proxies provided by our vendors can
be enabled as follows with the `enableProxy=true` param:

<CodeGroup>

    ```javascript Playwright (JavaScript)
    import { chromium } from "playwright-core";

    (async () => {
      const browser = await chromium.connectOverCDP(
        `wss://connect.browserbase.com?apiKey=${process.env.BROWSERBASE_API_KEY}&enableProxy=true`
      );

      // Getting the default context to ensure the sessions are recorded.
      const defaultContext = browser.contexts()[0];
      const page = defaultContext.pages()[0];

      await page.goto("https://browserbase.com/");
      await page.close();
      await browser.close();
    })().catch((error) => console.error(error.message));
    ```

    ```javascript Puppeteer (JavaScript)
    import puppeteer from "puppeteer-core";

    (async () => {
      const browser = await puppeteer.connect({
        browserWSEndpoint:
        `wss://connect.browserbase.com?apiKey=${process.env.BROWSERBASE_API_KEY}&enableProxy=true`
      });

      const page = await browser.newPage();

      await page.goto("https://www.browserbase.com");
      await page.close();
      await browser.close();
    })().catch((error) => console.error(error.message));
    ```

    ```python Python
    from playwright.sync_api import sync_playwright, Playwright

    def run(playwright: Playwright):
        chromium = playwright.chromium
        browser = chromium.connect_over_cdp('wss://connect.browserbase.com?apiKey=${process.env.BROWSERBASE_API_KEY}&enableProxy=true')
        context = browser.contexts[0]
        page = context.pages[0]

    with sync_playwright() as playwright:
        run(playwright)
    ```

    </CodeGroup>

### Fingerprinting

The fingerprint mechanism handles the viewport, user agents, and headers.
Geolocation will be configurable in the future.

We also plan to implement advanced Stealth mechanisms such as user gesture
impersonation.

### Captcha solving

Captchas get automatically detected and solved.

Captcha solvers are currently in beta; please get in touch with us to test it.

## Limitations

- We bundle proxies into the browser so you don't have to worry about it. This
  means that bringing your own proxy vendor is not supported at this time.
- Additionally, some high-risk categories are restricted by our proxy vendors
  and cannot be proxied; this includes:
  - All Apple domains, including iTunes and App stores
  - Entertainment (e.g., Netflix, Playstation)
  - Banking and other financial institutions
  - Some Google domains
  - Government websites
  - Streaming
  - Ticketing
  - LinkedIn
  - Mailing
