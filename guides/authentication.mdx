Authentication flows, along with an anti-bot mechanism, add complexity to
automation. Two-factor authentication and captchas are challenging to overcome,
and regular authentication flows slow down automation.

Fortunately, Browserbase [Stealth Mode](/features/stealth-mode), along with some
tactics, helps to go over authentication flows without interruption and to reuse
sessions for faster automation.

## Accessing an authentication flow with Stealth Mode

Most authentication flows implement mechanisms to prevent automation and
scraping:

- IP addresses restrictions
- User Agent filtering
- Captchas (ex:
  [Clerk now features a Captcha on all authentication flows](https://clerk.com/changelog/2024-04-19-visual-captcha))
- Rate limiting

When running your own Browser, dealing with the above requires setup IP
rotations with Proxies along with Captcha solving and fingerprinting code or
libraries.

By connecting your automation to Browserbase, you get opt-in
[Proxies](/features/stealth-mode), automatic fingerprinting, and Captcha solving
without any code change:

```javascript Playwright (JavaScript)
import { chromium } from "playwright-core";

(async () => {
  const browser = await chromium.connectOverCDP(
    `wss://connect.browserbase.com?apiKey=${process.env.BROWSERBASE_API_KEY}&enableProxy=true`,
  );

  // Getting the default context to ensure the sessions are recorded.
  const defaultContext = browser.contexts()[0];
  const page = defaultContext.pages()[0];

  await page.goto("https://browserbase.com/sign-in");
  await page.close();
  await browser.close();
})().catch((error) => console.error(error.message));
```

## Dealing with OAuth and Session-based authentication flows

Some services rely on OAuth authentication (tokens) or Sessions (cookies).

The cookies used as part of those authentication flows are set by external
services (with `CORS` or `SameSite` attribute restrictions), making them
inaccessible with the Puppeteer or Playwright APIs.

A good practice to handle such advanced authentication flows is to create a
custom Chrome Extension responsible for intercepting and storing cookies or
tokens.

## Dealing with two-factor authentication

Two-step verification (via authenticator apps or SMS) or magic links require
human intervention in the loop. Here are some tactics to cope with 2FA:

### Disable 2FA or create an app password

<Note>
  This approach only applies to authentication flows owned by your team or
  company.
</Note>

For an internal tool, try to turn off the
[two-step verification](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/1064203?hl=en&co=GENIE.Platform%3DDesktop).

For an authentication flow requiring some level of security,
[try to create an app password](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/185833?hl=en).

### Enable Remote Control of your Session

If the two-step verification mechanism cannot be bypassed, you should consider
handing back the control to the end user by leveraging the Session Connection
Debug URLs.
