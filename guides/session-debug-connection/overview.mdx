Browserbase offers the [Session Debugger](/features/session-debugger), a
complete tool to inspect completed Sessions. However, many use cases require
direct interaction with the running Session or can benefit from direct debugging
from the local Browser.

## Getting Session Debug Connection URLs

Getting Session Debug Connection URLs is achieved by using the
[Session Debug Connection URL endpoint](/api-reference/retrieve-a-session-debug-connection-urls):

<Steps>

<Step title="Start a Session">
  Use the [Session API](/api-reference/create-a-session) to create a new session
  ([_give it a try from the API Playground_](/api-reference/create-a-session)).
</Step>

<Step title="Request a debug connection URL">
  Then, use the [Session API debug
  endpoint](/api-reference/retrieve-a-session-debug-connection-urls) to get the
  `debuggerFullscreenUrl`.
</Step>

<Step title="Open the Session from your local Chrome browser">
  Finally, open the `debuggerFullscreenUrl` URL in Chrome to start taking action
  on the session.
</Step>

</Steps>
