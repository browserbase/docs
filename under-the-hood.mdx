The Browserbase Platform is the solution to all the reliability, scalability,
and fingerprinting challenges that working with headless browsers brings. Let's
take a closer look at it:

## Dashboard

The Dashboard is the collaborative place to access real-time information to all
[Sessions](/sessions) and essential metrics.

[Session Replay](/session-replay) is the central feature, providing video
replay, logs, and other Chrome Devtools data for a specific Session.

<Card title="Quickstart" icon="book" iconType="light" href="/quickstart">

## APIs and Orchestrator

Through the Orchestrator, Browserbase offers multiple public APIs
([Sessions API](/api-reference/sessions),
[Extensions API](/api-reference/extensions)), granting direct access to the
underlying Browser Sessions.

The Orchestrator is vital in:

- Maintaining the [Sessions's state](/session#sessions-lifecycle) by managing
  the Serverless infrastructure and resources allocation
- Capturing live session videos and Chrome Dev tools logs and network data used
  by the [Session Replay](/session-replay)

</Card>

## Serverless Browsers

All Sessions run on a custom Chromium with advanced Stealth capabilities and
performance improvements, removing cold starts.

[Browsers](/browsers) are powered by an autoscaled and secured architecture,
providing all the benefits of Serverless infrastructure with fine-grained
control of resources.
