_TODO_

- Features
  - Proxies
  - Captcha solving -> soon (provide some links to guide for Captcha)
  - Other embedded bot avoidance features?
- Limitations
  - We don't currently have a captcha solver integrated, and if you face a
    captcha you'll need to handle it.
  - We bundle proxies into the browser so you don't have to worry about it. This
    means that bringing your own proxy vendor is not supported at this time.
  - Additionally, some high-risk categories are restricted by our proxy vendors
    and cannot be proxied, this includes:
    - All Apple domains, including iTunes and App stores
    - Entertainment (e.g., Netflix, Playstation)
    - Banking and other financial institutions
    - Some Google domains
    - Government websites
    - Streaming
    - Ticketing
    - LinkedIn
    - Mailing
