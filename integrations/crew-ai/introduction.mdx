## Introduction

LLM enables various use cases, one of the most advanced of them being Agents, programs designed to perform a set of tasks based on high-level instructions.

[CrewAI](https://www.crewai.com/) is a framework to create Crews, teams of Agents working together on a given problem, for example:
- [Trip Planner Crew](https://github.com/joaomdmoura/crewAI-examples/tree/main/trip_planner)
- [Prepare for meetings](https://github.com/joaomdmoura/crewAI-examples/tree/main/prep-for-a-meeting)
- [Instagram Marketing Crew](https://github.com/joaomdmoura/crewAI-examples/tree/main/instagram_post)


To achieve such results AI Agents rely on a set of tools to gather rich contexts and perform actions:

    u["User"]

    u--provides the objectives of the meeting-->c
    c--send meeting brief-->u

    subgraph c ["Crew"]
        subgraph tasks ["Tasks"]
            t1["Retrieve meeting information"]
            t2["Research on topic"]
            t3["Summarize meeting"]
        end

        subgraph agents ["Agents"]
            a1["Summary and briefing Agent"]
            a2["Industry Research Agent"]
        end
    end
```

Browserbase provides a [BrowserbaseLoadTool](https://docs.crewai.com/tools/BrowserbaseLoadTool/) that Agents can use to retrieve context from complex webpages such as:
- Extract text from webpages using JavaScript or anti-bot mechanisms
- Capture Images from webpages
